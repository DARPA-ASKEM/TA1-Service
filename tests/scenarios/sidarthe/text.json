Furthermore, when some of the model variables are not empirically accessible, as in the case of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they have to be obtained as an outcome of the model. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify how the uncertainty in the data affects the determination of the parameters and the evolution of the unmeasured variables of a given model. We illustrate how the method is able to characterize different regimes of identifiability, even in models with few compartments. Last, we discuss how the lack of identifiability in a realistic model for COVID-19 may prevent reliable predictions of the epidemic dynamics.",

		"content": "INTRODUCTION The  pandemic  caused  by  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome coronavirus-2 is challenging humanity in an unprecedented way (1), with the disease, which in a few months has spread around the world, affecting large parts of the population (2,\u00a03) and often requir- ing hospitalization or even intensive care (4,\u00a05). Mitigating the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urges synergistic efforts to understand, predict, and control the many, often elusive, facets of the complex phenomenon of the spreading of a previously unknown virus, from RNA sequencing to the study of the virus pathogenicity and  transmissibility  (6,\u00a0 7)  to  the  definition  of  suitable  epidemic spreading models (8) and the investigation of nonpharmaceutical intervention policies and containment measures (9\u201312). In particu- lar, a large number of epidemic models have recently been proposed to describe the evolution of COVID-19 and evaluate the effectiveness of different counteracting measures, including social distancing, testing, and contact tracing (13\u201319). However, even the adoption of well-consolidated modeling techniques, such as the use of mecha- nistic models at the population level based on compartments, poses fundamental problems. First of all, the very same choice of the dynamical variables to use in a compartmental model is crucial; as such, variables should adequately capture the spreading mecha- nisms and need to be tailored to the specific disease. This step is not straightforward, especially when the spreading mechanisms of the disease are still unknown or only partially identified. In addition, some of the variables considered might be difficult to measure and track as, for instance, in the case of COVID-19, it occurred in the number of individuals showing mild or no symptoms. Second, compartmental models, usually, involve a number of parameters, including the initial values of the unmeasured variables, which are not known and need to be estimated from data.",

		"content": "Having at disposal a large amount of data, unfortunately, does not simplify the problem of parameter estimation and prediction of unmeasured states. Once a model is formulated, it may occur that some of its unknown parameters are intrinsically impossible to determine from the measured variables or that they are numerically very sensitive to the measurements themselves. In the first case, it is the very same structure of the model to hamper parameter estima- tion as the system admits infinitely many sets of parameters that fit the data equally well; for this reason, this problem is referred to as structural identifiability (20,\u00a021). In the second case, although under ideal  conditions  (i.e.,  noise-free  data  and  error-free  models)  the problem of parameter estimation can be uniquely solved for some trajectories, it may be numerically ill conditioned, such that from a practical point of view, the parameters cannot be determined with precision even if the model is structurally identifiable (22). This situation typically occurs when large changes in the parameters entail a small variation of the measured variables, such that two similar trajectories may correspond to very different parameters (23). The term practical identifiability is adopted in this case. Identifiability in general represents an important property of a dynamical system, as in a nonidentifiable system, different sets of parameters can produce the same or very similar fits of the data. Consequently, predictions from a nonidentifiable system become unreliable. In the context of epidemics forecasting, this means that even  if  the  model  considered  is  able  to  reproduce  the  measured variables, a large uncertainty may affect the estimated values of the parameters and the predicted evolution of the unmeasured variables (24). The problem of practical identifiability of model parameters has been investigated using different methodologies based on Fisher's information theory (25,\u00a026), profile likelihood (27), Monte Carlo simulations (28), and other computational approaches (29). How- ever, the lack of practical identifiability can also affect the reliability of the prediction of the unmeasured variables dynamics (27), an issue of utmost importance in the context of COVID-19, which nevertheless still requires a systematic investigation. In particular, an approach to simultaneously characterize the problem of sensitivity to parameters and that of the reliability of predictions of unmeasured variables is still missing. In more detail, in this paper, we investigate the problem of the practical identifiability of dynamical systems whose state includes",

We present a general framework to quantify not only the sensitivity of the measured variables of a given model on its parameters but also the sensitiv- ity of the unmeasured variables on the parameters and on the measured variables. This will allow us to introduce the notion of practical identifiability of the hidden variables of a model. As a relevant and timely application, we show the variety of different regimes and levels of identifiability that can appear in epidemic models, even in the simplest case of a four compartment system. Last, we study the actual effects of the lack of practical identifiability in more sophisticated models introduced for COVID-19.",

Notice that in this case, and differently from \uf073, lower values of \uf068 are desirable because they imply a better prediction on the hidden variables.

In addition, the parameter \uf06d2 can be efficiently computed as it corresponds to the maximum general- ized  eigenvalue  of  matrices  (H,  M),  as  shown  in  Materials  and Methods. The  sensitivity  matrices  are  useful  in  studying  the  effect  of changing the number of hidden variables and unknown parameters on the practical identifiability of a model. Assume that we have access to one more variable, thus effectively increasing the size of the set of measured variables to nm\u2032 = nm + 1 and, correspondingly, reducing that of the unmeasured variables to nh\u2032 = nh \u2212 1. This cor- responds to considering new variables m\u00b4 and h\u00b4. From the defini- tion in Eq. 3, the new sensitivity matrix can be written as M\u2032 = M + M1, where M1 is the sensitivity matrix for the newly measured variable.

This means that measuring one further variable (or more than one) of the system increases the practical identifiability of a model, as expected. As H\u2032 = H \u2212 M1, it is also possible to demon- strate that \uf06d(M\u2032) \u2264 \uf06d(M) (see Materials and Methods). Let us now consider a different scenario: Suppose we have a priori knowledge of one of the model parameters so that we do not need to estimate its value by fitting the model to the data. In this case, we can define unmeasured variables, respectively. Given the Cauchy's interlacing new sensitivity matrices   \u02dc M ,  \u02dc H  \u2208   \u211d   ( n  p  \u22121)\u00d7( n  p  \u22121)   for the measured and theorem [page 242 of (30)], we have that   \uf06c  1  ( \u02dc M  ) \u2265  \uf06c  1  (M) , which im- plies that practical identifiability is improved by acquiring a priori in- formation on some of the model parameters. For instance, in the context of COVID-19 models, one may decide to fix some of the parameters,  such  as  the  rate  of  recovery,  to  values  derived  from medical  and  biological  knowledge  (24,\u00a0 31\u201333)  and  to  determine from fitting the more elusive parameters, such as the percentage of asymptomatic individuals or the rates of transmission. The sensitivity measures we have introduced point out that prior knowledge of some of the parameters, or a larger set of measurable variables, reduces the sensitivity of the measured variables to the parameters and that of the hidden variables to a variation in the measured ones. However, gathering further knowledge can be diffi- cult or even not possible so that these results, which should not be interpreted as an oversimplified solution to the problem of identifi- ability, have to be considered in the light of practical issues that might arise in the measurement of the model variables and pa- rameters.",

		"content": "The sensitivity measures reveal different regimes of identifiability As a first application, we study the practical identifiability of a four compartment mean-field epidemic model (34) in the class of SIAR models (35), developed to assess the impact of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 (8,\u00a036,\u00a037) and other diseases (38\u201340). In such a model (Fig.\u00a01), a susceptible individual (S) can be infected by an infectious individual who can either be symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A). The newly infected individual can either be symptomatic (S \u2192 I) or asymptomatic (S \u2192 A). Furthermore, we also consider the possibility that asymptomatic individuals develop symptoms (A \u2192 I), thus accounting for the cases in which an individual can infect before and after the onset of the symptoms (41). Last, we suppose that individuals  cannot  be  reinfected  as  they  acquire  a  permanent immunity (R). One of the crucial aspects of COVID-19 is the presence of asymptomatic individuals who are difficult to trace as the individuals themselves could be unaware about their state. Consequently, we assume that the fraction of asymptomatic individuals, a(t), is not measurable, while the fractions of symptomatic, \uf069(t), and recovered, r(t), are measured variables, that is, m \u2261 [\uf069, r] and h \u2261 [s, a]. As mentioned above, practical identifiability is a property of the trajec- tories of the system, which are uniquely determined by the values of the unknown parameters p. Here, we illustrate how the sensitivity of  both  measured  and  unmeasured  variables  changes  with  the probability \uf067 that a newly infected individual shows no symptoms when all the other parameters of the model are fixed (to the values reported in Materials and Methods). Concerning the choice of vector p, here, we consider the following case. First, as the number of symptomatic infectious and recovered individuals are supposed",

		"content": "to be measurable, we have assumed the initial conditions \uf069(0), r(0), and the recovery rate of the symptomatic individuals, i.e., \uf061IR,to be known quantities. Second, we assume to be able to measure, for instance, through backward contact tracing, the rate at which asymptomatic individuals develop symptoms, i.e., \uf061AI. Hence, the parameters to be determined are the remaining ones, i.e., p = [a(0), \uf062I, \uf062A, \uf067, \uf061AR]. Figure\u00a02A shows a nontrivial nonmonotonic dependence of our sensitivity measures, \uf073 and \uf068, on \uf067. The value of \uf073 has a peak at \uf067 = 0.51, in correspondence of which \uf068 takes its minimum value. This represents an optimal condition for practical identifiability, as the sensitivity to parameters of the measured variables is high, while that  of  the  unmeasured  ones  is  low,  and  this  implies  that  the unknown quantities of the system (both the model parameters and the hidden variables) can be estimated with small uncertainty. On the contrary, for \uf067 = 0.86, we observe a relatively small value of \uf073 and  a  large  value  of  \uf068,  meaning  that  the  measured  variables  are poorly identifiable, and the unmeasured variables are sensitive to a variation of parameters. This is the worst situation in which the estimated parameters may substantially differ from the real values, and the hidden variables may experience large variations even for small  changes  in  the  parameters.  Furthermore,  the  quantity  \uf06d, which  measures  the  sensitivity  of  the  hidden  variables  to  the measured ones, reported in Fig.\u00a02B, exhibits a large peak at the value of \uf067 for which \uf073 is minimal. This is due to the fact that the vector that determines \uf06d is almost aligned with v1. When this holds, we have that \uf06d = \u03b7/\uf073, which explains the presence of the spike in the \uf06d curve. Similarly, the sensitivity  \uf06d takes its minimum almost in correspondence of the maximum of \uf073. The behavior of the model for \uf067 = 0.86 is further illustrated in Fig.\u00a02C, where the trajectories obtained in correspondence to the unperturbed values of the parameters, i.e., m(t, p) and h(t, p) (solid lines), are compared with the dynamics observed when p undergoes a perturbation with \u2225\uf064p\u2225 = 0.3\u2225p\u2225 along v1 (dashed lines). The small sensitivity \uf073 of the measured variables \uf069(t, p) and r(t, p) to parameters is reflected into perturbed trajectories that remain close to the unperturbed ones, whereas the large sensitivity \uf068 of the unmeasured variables s(t, p) and a(t,  p) yields perturbed trajectories that significantly deviate from the unperturbed ones. We now illustrate the different levels of identifiability that appear in the SIAR model for diverse settings of the parameters. Its analysis, in fact, fully depicts the more complete perspective on the",

As the two sensitivity measures are not necessarily correlated, there can be cases for which a high identifiability of the measured variables to the parameters, i.e., large values of \uf073, corresponds to either a low or a high identifi- ability of the hidden variables to the parameters. Analogously, for other system configurations, in correspondence of small values of \uf073, namely, to nonidentifiable parameters, one may find large values of \uf068, meaning that the hidden variables are nonidentifiable as well or, on the contrary, small values of \uf068, indicating that the hidden variables are poorly sensitive to parameter perturbations. Together, four distinct scenarios of identifiability can occur, and all of them effectively appear in the SIAR model (Fig. 3): (A) low identifiability of the model parameters p and high identifiability of the hidden variables h, (B) high identifiability of both p and h, (C) low identifiability of both p and h, and (D) high identifiability of p and low identifiability of h. To illustrate them, we have considered four distinct configura- tions of the model (with parameters as given in Table\u00a03 and illus- trated in Materials and Methods) and, for each case study, compared the unperturbed trajectories to the perturbed ones, with the vector of parameters undergoing a variation \u2225\uf064p \u2225 = 0.3 \u2225 p\u2225 along v1.

However, a high sensitivity of the hidden variables to measured ones has relevant practical consequences, especially when the parameters are unknown and need to be fitted from data. In these conditions, a small uncertainty in the measurable variables due to the presence of noise in the data can propagate markedly and make the prediction of the hidden variables unreliable. Hence, in this section, we study how the lack of practical identifiability",

		"content": "can affect the predictions of the SIAR model when this is fitted to empirical data. The reliability of the model predictions has been investigated  by  means  of  two  different  fitting  techniques:  a  least square error minimization procedure (42), which provides a point estimate of the parameters, and a Bayesian inference approach (43), which, conversely, gives an estimate of the probability distribution in the parameter space. To carry out the numerical analysis, we consider the model under the same settings (i.e., fixing the values of the six parameters and the initial values of three variables) as those adopted in case (C) in the previous section, which correspond to the case of low identifiability of both the parameters and the hidden variables. We then generate from such a model a synthetic dataset of trajectories, which we fit using the two approaches mentioned above (see Materials and Methods for further details). All the model parameters  are  considered  unknown  and  thus  need  to  be  deter- mined through the fit. First, we consider the least square error minimization approach. To show how, because of the lack of identifiability of the model, significant variations in the dynamics of the hidden variables can be obtained when fitting the measured variables, we have performed the  following  analysis.  As  the  estimation  procedure  (based  on  a nonlinear optimization algorithm; see Materials and Methods) starts from an initial guess of the fitting parameters, indicated as p0, instead of fitting a single set of values, we have repeated the proce- dure under the very same conditions of the algorithm, for 500 runs, randomly selecting p0 from a Gaussian distribution centered on a fixed point of the parameter space and with variance equal to 0.25. We then discarded those runs yielding a fitting error d > 0.015, which corresponds to a relative error of 2.5%, thus keeping a total of 65 sets of parameters fitting the measured variables with a similar value of the error. The fact that different sets of parameters are obtained in this way may indicate that the error function has several local minima. Figure\u00a04\u00a0(A\u00a0to\u00a0D) displays the average trajectories (over the 65 sets of parameters) of the four state variables (solid lines) and the respective regions where 95% of the trajectories lie (shadowed  area).  While  the  dynamics  of  the  measured  variables (Fig.\u00a04,\u00a0C\u00a0and\u00a0D) produced by the SIAR model are in very good agreement with the data, the same is not true for the temporal evolution of the hidden variables (Fig.\u00a04,\u00a0A\u00a0and\u00a0B).

		"content": "number of newly asymptomatic infected individuals is substantially overestimated. We now consider the Bayesian inference approach. To imple- ment it, we used the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) (44), a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, with set- tings as described in Materials and Methods. In particular, since we have here assumed to have no a priori information on the value of the model parameters, we have considered uniform prior probability distributions, representing the less informative conditions for the model (further details are given in Materials and Methods). Figure\u00a04\u00a0(E\u00a0to\u00a0H) shows the temporal evolution of the SIAR variables. Solid lines represent the average trajectory obtained by sampling 500 sets of parameters from the posterior distributions, while the shadowed areas indicate the regions where 95% of the trajectories lie. Similarly, to the case of the least square minimization, while the dynamics of the measured variables (Fig.\u00a04,\u00a0G\u00a0and\u00a0H) is in a good agreement  with  the  synthetic  data,  the  prediction  of  the  hidden variables (Fig.\u00a04,\u00a0E\u00a0and\u00a0F) is not. At variance with the previous example, the number of newly asymptomatic infected individuals is here largely underestimated. Hence, these results indicate that the lack  of  identifiability  can  lead  to  unreliable  results  even  when  a Bayesian approach is adopted. In  the  analysis  presented  in  this  section,  we  have  assumed  to have no a priori information on the values of the model parameters. Therefore, when performing the least square error minimization, we have extracted all the parameters from fitting, while, following the same reasoning, we have chosen a uniform prior probability distribution in the Bayesian approach. When instead we have strong a priori knowledge of a disease, this can be used to inform the models, by fixing the values of certain parameters while estimating the others, in the case of the least square error method, or by considering  more  informative  prior  distributions,  in  the  case  of Bayesian inference. When a priori information on the values of the parameters  can  be  obtained,  for  instance,  through  medical  and biological studies, the model predictions are expected to become less affected by uncertainty. The analysis of the sensitivity matrices (see also Materials and Methods) confirms this expectation as we have demonstrated that additional knowledge of the parameters, or",

		"content": "data. Hence, as in (16), we have assumed all the model parameters to be unknown. To show how significant variations in the evolution of the hidden variables can arise when fitting the measured variables, we have performed a numerical analysis similar to the one of the previous section. Again, rather than fitting a single set of values, we have repeated the minimization procedure under the same conditions of the algorithm, for 500 runs, randomly selecting the initial guess p0 from a Gaussian distribution centered on a fixed point of the pa- rameter space, with variance equal to 0.25. We discarded the runs yielding a fitting error e > 900, corresponding to a relative error of 1.4%, thus keeping a total of 40 sets of parameters. Figure\u00a06 shows the dynamical trajectories that we have obtained for each of the 40 sets of parameters (solid lines). Both measured (Fig.\u00a06,\u00a0A\u00a0to\u00a0D) and hidden (Fig.\u00a06,\u00a0E\u00a0to\u00a0H) variables are reported. While the time evolution of the measured variables produced by the model is in very good agreement with the empirical data, reported as circles in Fig.\u00a06, significant differences in the trend of the hidden variables appear. A large variability is observed, confirming that the lack of identifiability yields a high sensitivity of the hidden variables to the measured one. These findings have relevant implications. The large uncertainty on the size of the asymptomatic population makes questionable the use of the model as a tool to decide the policies to adopt.",

		"content": "DISCUSSION The practical identifiability of a dynamical model is a critical, but often neglected, issue in determining the reliability of its predic- tions. In this paper, we have introduced a novel framework to quantify: (i) the sensitivity of the dynamical variables of a given model to its parameters, even in the presence of variables that are difficult to access empirically and (ii) how changes in the measured variables affect the evolution of the unmeasured ones. The measures we have proposed are easy to compute and enable to assess, for instance, if and when the model predictions on the unmeasured variables are reliable or not, even in the cases in which the parameters of the model can be fitted with high accuracy from the available data. As we have shown with a series of case studies, practical identifi- ability can critically affect the predictions of even very refined epidemic models introduced for the description of COVID-19, where dynamical variables, such as the population of asymptomatic individuals, are impossible or difficult to measure. This by no means should question the importance of these models\u2014in that they enable a scenario analysis, otherwise impossible to carry out, and a deeper understanding of the spreading mechanisms of a novel disease\u2014but should hallmark the relevance of a critical analysis of the results that takes into account sensitivity measures. It also high- lights the importance of cross-disciplinary efforts that can provide a priori information on some of the parameters, ultimately improv- ing the reliability of a model (8,\u00a024). A problem related to the one studied in our paper is that of observability,  which  investigates  how  to  reconstruct  the  internal state of a system from measurements on the input and output, under the hypothesis that the model and its parameters are known (51,\u00a052). Techniques based on the observability problem are clearly extremely important and may be applied, for instance, to derive the time evolution of asymptomatic individuals from measurements on",

The numerical evaluation of the sensitivity matrices is carried out first by integrating system in eq. 7 (for this step we use a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver with adaptive step size control), resampling the trajectories with a sampling period of 1 day, and then performing a discrete summation over the sampled trajectories. Moreover, inte- gration is carried out over a finite time interval [0,  \uf074], with large enough \uf074. In the context of our work, as we have considered SIR (susceptible infected removed)-like epidemic models, we set the value of \uf074 such that the system has reached a stationary state, i.e., the epidemic outbreak has ended, as every infected individual has eventually recovered (or dead, depending on the model). We now present an important property of the sensitivity matri- ces. We will only take into account the set of measured variables m, as similar considerations can be made for the hidden variables. Let us assume to be able to measure only a single variable, so that the vector m collapses into a scalar function, which we call m1(t). In this case, the element Mij of the sensitivity matrix would be simply given by",

		"content": "Sensitivity measures and their properties Here, we discuss in more detail the sensitivity measures introduced in Results. First, we want to propose a measure to quantify the practical identifiability of the model parameters given the measured variables. To do this, we need to evaluate the sensitivity of the trajectories of the measured variables to a variation of the model parameters. If this sensitivity is small, then different sets of parame- ters will produce very similar trajectories of the measured variables, meaning that the parameters themselves are poorly identifiable. In particular,  as  a  measure  of  the  parameters  identifiability,  we  can consider the worst scenario, namely, the case in which the perturba- tion of the parameters minimizes the change in the measured vari- ables. This happens when the variation of the model parameters \uf064p is aligned along the eigenvector v1 of M corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue \uf06c1(M). Given the definition of M, we have that _  \uf06c  1  (M)   \u2225  \uf064p \u2225 ; hence, we can consider the quantity \u2225 \uf064m  \u2225 =  \u221a",

Let us assume now that we are able to measure one further variable, thus increasing the size of the set of measured variables to nm\u2032 = nm + 1 and, correspondingly, reducing that of the unmeasured variables to nh\u2032 = nh \u2212 1. Given the property in Eq. 10, the new sensitivity matrices can be written as M\u2032 = M + M1 and H\u2032 = H \u2212 M1, where by M1, we denote the sensitivity matrix for the newly mea- sured variable.

Here, \uf062I and \uf062A are the transmission rates for the symptomatic and the asymptomatic individuals, respectively, \uf067 is the probability for newly infected indi- viduals to show no symptoms, \uf061AI is the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, and \uf061IR and \uf061AR are the recovery rates for the two infectious populations. Note that all these parame- ters are positive quantities. Asymptomatic individuals are difficult to trace as the individuals themselves could be unaware about their state. As a consequence, we  assume  that  the  density  of  asymptomatic  individuals  is  not measurable, while the densities of symptomatic and recovered indi- viduals  are  measured  variables.  According  to  the  notation  intro- duced in Eq. 1, we therefore have that m \u2261 [\uf069, r] and h \u2261 [s, a]. Note that, as a first approximation, here, we assume to be able to trace the asymptomatic individuals once they recover. The results presented in Fig.\u00a02 have been obtained considering the following setup. As the number of symptomatic infectious and recovered individuals are considered measurable, we have assumed that the initial conditions \uf069(0), r(0), and the rate of recovery \uf061IR are known parameters. Second, we have supposed to be able to measure, for instance, through backward contact tracing the rate at which asymptomatic individuals develop symptoms, i.e., \uf061AI. Hence, the vector of parameters to determine by calibrating the model is given by p = [a(0), \uf062I, \uf062A, \uf067, \uf061AR]. Table\u00a02 displays the value of the model parameters used to obtain the results shown in Fig.\u00a02. For the analysis of the four scenarios considered in Fig.\u00a03, the values of the model parameters have been set as given in Table\u00a03. Furthermore, to better contrast the results arising in the different case studies, in (A) and (C), we have considered p = [\uf069(0), a(0),",

		"content": "Estimating the parameters of the SIAR model The SIAR model parameters have been estimated from data by adopting two different approaches, i.e., a nonlinear least square error minimization and a Bayesian inference. To generate a synthetic dataset, we have integrated the deterministic model in Eq. 21. To mimic measurement errors, we have adopted the following proce- dure. First, we compute   r \u0304  (t)  by adding to r(t) a uniform noise in the interval (\u2212 \uf064t/2, \uf064t/2), where \uf064t = \u2223r(t + 1) \u2212 r(t)\u2223, checking that the synthetic time series remains monotonically nondecreasing. We have then generated the data   s \u0304  (t)  in a similar fashion, this time controlling  that  the  synthetic  time  series  remains  monotonically nonincreasing. To generate the data   \uf069\u202f\u0304  (t) , we have added a Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation (SD) equals to 3% to the time series, making sure that   s \u0304  (t ) +  \uf069\u202f\u0304  (t ) +  r \u0304  (t ) \u2264 1 . Last, the data   a \u0304  (t) have been evaluated using the fact that   s \u0304  (t ) +  \uf069\u202f\u0304  (t ) +  a \u0304  (t ) +  r \u0304  (t ) = 1 . The integration of Eq. 21 has been carried out by using the lsoda ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver (53,\u00a054) and then resa- mpling the data with a sampling period of one time unit. We assumed that the density of asymptomatic individuals a is not measurable, while the densities of symptomatic and recovered individuals, i.e., \uf069 and r, are measured variables. As regard to the least square error minimization approach, the model parameters have been estimated using a nonlinear optimiza- tion procedure (implemented via the function fmincon in MATLAB) with the following objective function to minimize ______________________________ \uf074     (22)  1 \u2500 2\uf074\u202f    \u2211 (     (\uf069(k ) \u2212  _ \uf069 (k ) )   2  +  (r(k ) \u2212   _ r  (k ) )   2  ) k=1 d  =   \u221a where   \uf069\u202f\u0304  (k)  and   r \u0304  (k)  with k = 1, \u2026, \uf074 (with \uf074 = 50) represent the noisy synthetic time series of the densities of infectious and recovered individuals, respectively, while  \uf069(k) and r(k) are the values of the corresponding variables obtained from the integration of Eq. 21. The core idea of Bayesian inference is to provide an a posteriori probability distribution for the model parameter vector, p, given an a priori probability distribution on the value of p and a likelihood function, which quantifies the goodness of a model in reproducing empirical data D. The relationship between these is given by the Bayes' theorem, which reads",

Usually, it is not possible to evaluate analytically the integral appearing in the denominator, es- pecially when a large number of parameters are considered. There- fore, one relies on MCMC algorithms, which allow one to approximate of the posterior distribution. The MCMC algorithm we used to implement the Bayesian inference is the DRAM (44). As the likeli- hood function \u2112(D\u2223p), we have considered the root mean square error, evaluated on the measurable variables only, i.e. \uf069(t) and r(t), which corresponds to Eq. 22, namely, to the objective function of the nonlinear optimization procedure. As we have assumed to have no a priori knowledge of the values of the model parameters, for the Bayesian inference, we have considered uniform prior probability distributions, which are the simplest and least informative choice (55,\u00a056). Flat priors do not require any additional information apart from setting the interval of possible parameter values. These inter- vals have been defined taking into account the following consider- ations.  On  the  one  hand,  we  have  the  initial  conditions  of  the dynamical variables. As in the SIAR model, these represent popula- tion  densities,  we  can  assume  the  uniform  prior  distribution  for their initial conditions to be defined in the interval [0,1]. Similarly, the parameter \uf067, which indicates the fraction of newly infected indi- viduals not developing symptoms, can be assumed to be defined in the same interval. As regard the remaining parameters, since we have assumed to not have any other information except for the fact that they are positive quantities, we can consider the uniform distri- bution to be extended in the interval [0, \u221e ].",

The model, therefore, includes four classes of infectious individuals: undetected asymptomatic (IA), undetected symptomatic and pauci-symptomatic (IS), home isolated (H, corre- sponding to detected asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic), and treated in hospital (T, corresponding to detected symptomatic). Last, removed individuals can be undetected (Ru), detected (Rd), or deceased (D). The model dynamics is described by the following equations \u23aa",

		"content": "where  the  state  variables  represent  the  number  of  individuals  in each compartment, N = 60 \u00b7 106 and S + E + IA + IS + H + T + Ru + Rd + D = N. The official data on the spreading of COVID-19\u00a0in Italy made available by the Civil Protection Department [Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, (49)] provide information only on four of the nine compartments of the model, namely, the home isolated (H), hospitalized (T), detected recovered (Rd), and deceased indi- viduals (D). These compartments constitute the set of the measured variables, while the other variables have to be considered as hidden, i.e., m \u2261 [H, T, Rd, D] and h \u2261 [S, E, IA, IS, Ru]. All the parameters appearing in (24) are considered unknown; thus, they need to be determined through fitting the model to the available data. It should also be noted that, as many nonpharmaceu- tical interventions have been issued/lifted, and the testing strategy has been changed several times over the course of the epidemics (47,\u00a048), not all parameters can be considered constant in the whole period used for the fitting. Hence, similarly to (16), we have divided the whole period of investigation (which in our case ranges from 24 February to 06 July 2020) into different windows, within each of which the parameters are assumed to be constant. In each time window,  one  allows  only  some  parameters  to  vary  according  to what is reasonable to assume will be influenced by the government intervention during that time window. We distinguish two kinds of events that may require an adapta- tion of the model parameters. On the one hand, there are the non- pharmaceutical containment policies aimed at reducing the disease transmission. When these interventions are issued, the value of the parameters  \uf062  may  vary.  On  the  other  hand,  the  testing  strategy, which affects the probability of detecting infected individuals, was also not uniform in the investigated period. When the testing policy changes, the value of the parameters   \uf061   I  S  H   , \uf061HT, and   \uf061   HR   d     may vary. Here, we notice two important points. First, the value of   \uf061   I  S  T    is assumed to be constant in the whole period, as we suppose that there are no changes in how the symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalization are detected. Second, as a change in the sole param- eter   \uf061   I  S  H    would affect too much the average time an individual remains infected, then \uf061HT and   \uf061   HR   d     also have to be included in the set of parameters that may change. On the basis of these consider- ations, the intervals in which each parameter remains constant or may  change  are  identified.  This  defines  the  specific  piece-wise waveform assumed for each of the parameters appearing in the model and, consequently, the effective number of values that need to be estimated for each parameter. Hereafter,  we  summarize  the  events  defining  the  different windows in which the whole period of investigation is partitioned: 1) On 02 March, a policy limiting screening only to symptomatic individuals is introduced. 2) On 12 March, a partial lockdown is issued. 3)  On  18  March,  a  stricter  lockdown,  which  further  limits nonessential activities, is imposed. 4) On 29 March, a wider testing campaign is launched. Starting from this date, as the number of tests has constantly increased while the number of new infections was decreasing, the parameters are allowed to change every 14 or 28 days, namely, on 11 April, 25 April, and 23 May. 5) On 04 May, a partial lockdown lift is proclaimed. 6) On 18 May, further restrictions are relaxed. 7) On 03 June, interregional mobility is allowed. This is the last time the model parameters are changed.",
