Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID- 19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

        "content": "It  is  imperative  that  mathematical  models  are  developed  to provide  insights  and  make  predictions  about  the  pandemic,  to plan effective control strategies and policies [13–15] . Modelling ap- proaches [8,16–21] are helpful to understand and predict the pos- sibility and severity of the disease outbreak and, provide key in- formation  to  determine  the  intensity  of  COVID-19  disease  inter- vention. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and its ex- tended  modifications  [22–25] ,  such  as  the  extended-susceptible- infected-removed (eSIR) mathematical model in various forms have been  used  in  previous  studies  [26–28]  to  model  the  spread  of COVID-19 within communities. Here, we propose the use of a novel SIR model with different characteristics.  One  of  the  major  assumptions  of  the  classic  SIR model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected and susceptible populations and that the total population is constant in time. In the classic SIR model, the susceptible population de- creases monotonically towards zero. However, these assumptions are not valid in the case of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, since new epicentres spring up around the globe at different times. To account for this, the SIR model that we propose here does not con- sider the total population and takes the susceptible population as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community, resulting in an increase in the susceptible population, i.e., to the so-called surges. The SIR model we introduce here is given by the same sim- ple system of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the classic  SIR  model  and  can  be  used  to  gain  a  better  understand- ing of how the virus spreads within a community of variable pop- ulations in time, when surges occur. Importantly, it can be used to make predictions of the number of infections and deaths that may occur in the future and provide an estimate of the time scale for the duration of the virus within a community. It also provides us with insights on how we might lessen the impact of the virus, what is nearly impossible to discern from the recorded data alone! Consequently, our SIR model can provide a theoretical framework and  predictions  that  can  be  used  by  government  authorities  to control the spread of COVID-19. In our study, we used COVID-19 datasets from [29] in the form of time-series, spanning January to June, 2020. In particular, the time series are composed of three columns which represent the d , total cases I active cases I d and Deaths D d in time (rows). These tot datasets were used to update parameters of the SIR model to un- derstand the effects and estimate the trend of the disease in var- ious communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Aus- tralia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. This allowed us to estimate the development of COVID-19 spread in these com- munities by obtaining estimates for the number of deaths D , sus- ceptible S , infected I and removed R m populations in time. Conse- quently, we have been able to estimate its characteristics for these communities and assess the effectiveness of modelling the disease. The  paper  is  organised  as  following:  In  Sec.  2 ,  we  introduce the SIR model and discuss its various aspects. In Sec. 3 , we ex- plain  the  approach  we  used  to  study  the  data  in  [29]  and  in Sec. 4 , we present the results of our analysis for China, South Ko- rea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. Section 5 discusses the implications of our study to the \"flattening the curve\" approach. Finally, in Sec. 6 , we conclude our work and discuss the outcomes of our analysis and its connection to the ev- idence that has been already collected on the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.",

Here, we propose the use of a modified SIR model with characteristics, based upon the classic SIR model. In particular, one of the major assumptions of the classic SIR model is that there is a homogeneous mixing of the infected I and susceptible S popu- lations and that the total population N is constant in time. Also, in the SIR model, the susceptible population S decreases monoton- ically towards zero. These assumptions however are not valid in the case of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, since new epicen- tres spring up around the globe at different times. To account for this, we introduce here a SIR model that does not consider the to- tal population N , but rather, takes the susceptible population S as a variable that can be adjusted at various times to account for new infected individuals spreading throughout a community, resulting in its increase. Thus, our model is able to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals in time, whenever these oc- cur and as evidenced by published data, such as those in [29] that we consider here. Our SIR model is given by the same, simple system of three or- dinary differential equations (ODEs) with the classic SIR model that can be easily implemented and used to gain a better understanding of how the COVID-19 virus spreads within communities of variable populations in time, including the possibility of surges in the sus- ceptible populations. Thus, the SIR model here is designed to re- move many of the complexities associated with the real-time evo- lution of the spread of the virus, in a way that is useful both quan- titatively and qualitatively. It is a dynamical system that is given by three coupled ODEs that describe the time evolution of the follow- ing three populations:",

To account for such a possibility, S in the SIR model (1) , can be reset to S surge at any time t s that a surge occurs, and thus it can accom- modate multiple such surges if recorded in the published data in [29] , what distinguishes it from the classic SIR model. The evolution of the infected population I is governed by the second  ODE  in  system  1 ,  where  a  is  the  transmission  rate  con- stant  and  b  the  removal  rate  constant.

        "content": "The rate of increase in the number of infections depends on the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals. An understanding of the system of Eqs. (1) explains the staggering in- crease in the infection rate around the world. Infected people trav- eling around the world has led to the increase in infected numbers and this results in a further increase in the susceptible population [14] . This gives rise to a positive feedback loop leading to a very rapid rise in the number of active infected cases. Thus, during a surge period, the number of susceptible individuals increases and as a result, the number of infected individuals increases as well. For example, as of 1 March, 2020, there were 88,590 infected indi- viduals and by 3 April, 2020, this number had grown to a stagger- ing 1,015,877 [29] . Understanding  the  implications  of  what  the  system  of Eqs.  (1)  tells  us,  the  only  conclusion  to  be  drawn  using  scien- tific  principles  is  that  drastic  action  needs  to  be  taken  as  early as possible, while the numbers are still low, before the exponen- tial  increase  in  infections  starts  kicking  in.  For  example,  if  we consider the results of policies introduced in the UK to mitigate the spread of the disease, there were 267,240 total infections and 37,460 deaths by 27 May and in the USA, 1,755,803 and 102,107, total infections and deaths, respectively.  Thus,  even if one starts with  low  numbers  of  infected  individuals,  the  number  of  infec- tions  will  at  first  grow  slowly  and  then,  increase  approximately exponentially,  then  taper  off until  a  peak  is  reached.  Comparing these  results  for  the  UK  and  USA  with  those  for  South  Korea, where  steps  were  taken  immediately  to  reduce  the  susceptible population, there were 11,344 total infections and 269 deaths by 27 May. The number of infections in China reached a peak about 16 February, 2020. The government took extreme actions with clo- sures, confinement, social distancing, and people wearing masks. This type of action produces a decline in the number of infections and susceptible individuals. If the number of susceptible individu- als does not decrease, then the number of infections just gets in- creased rapidly. As at this moment, there is no effective vaccine developed, the only way to reduce the number of infections is to reduce the number of individuals that are susceptible to the dis-",

More  than 750 passengers and crew have become infected and 26 died. Two government  enquires  have  been  established  to  investigate  what went wrong. Also, at this time many infected overseas passengers arrived by air from Europe and the USA. The Australian govern- ment was too slow in quarantining arrivals from overseas. From mid-March, 2020 until mid-May, 2020, the Australian gov- ernments  introduced  measures  of  testing,  contact  tracing,  social distancing, staying at home policy, closure of many businesses and encouraging people to work from home. From Figs. 7 and 8 , it can be observed that actions taken were successful as the actual num- ber  of  infections  declined  in  accord  with  the  model  predictions. There have been no further surge periods. From end of May, 2020, these restrictions are being removed in stages. The SIR model can be used when future data becomes available to see if the number of susceptible individuals starts to increase. If so, the model can accommodate this by introducing surge factors.",

The virus started spread- ing in Washington State, followed by California, New York, Chicago and the southern states of the USA. The need to add surge periods shows clearly that the spread of the virus is not under control. In the USA, by the end of May, 2020, the number of active in- fected  cases  has  not  yet  peaked  and  the  cumulative  total  num- ber of infections keeps getting bigger. This can be accounted for in the SIR model by considering how the susceptible population changes  with  time  in  May.  During  that  time,  to  match  the  data to the model predictions, surge periods were used where the nor- malized susceptible population S was reset to 0.2 every four days. What is currently happening in the USA is that as susceptible in- dividuals become infected, their population decreases, with these infected  individuals  mixing  with  the  general  population,  leading to an increase in the susceptible population. This is shown in the model  by  the  variable  for  the  susceptible  population,  S ,  varying from about 0.06 to 0.20, repeatedly during May. Until this vicious cycle is broken, the cumulative total infected population will keep growing at a steady rate and not reach an almost steady-state. The fluctuating normalized susceptible variable provides clear evidence that government authorities do not have the spread of the virus under control (see Figs. 9 and 10 ).",

Hence, they con- cluded that by flattening the curve , it will have a lesser impact upon the demands in hospitals. Figure 17 (b) gives the scientific meaning of flattening the curve . By governments imposing appropriate mea- sures, the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced and combined with isolating infected individuals, will reduce the peak number of infections. When this is done, it actually shortens the time the virus impacts the society. Thus, the second claim has no scientific basis and is incorrect. What is important is reducing the peak in the number of infections and when this is done, it shortens the duration in which drastic measures need to be taken and not lengthen the period as stated in the media and by government of- ficials. Figure 17 shows that the peak number of infections actually reduces the duration of the impact of the virus on a community.",

They provide us with useful predictions in the context of the impact of inter- vention in decreasing the number of infected-susceptible incidence rates [30–32] . In this work, we have augmented the classic SIR model with the ability to accommodate surges in the number of susceptible individuals, supplemented by recorded data from China, South Ko- rea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 in communities. In all cases, the model predictions could be fitted to the published data reasonably well, with some fits better than others. For China, the actual number of infections fell more rapidly than the model prediction, which is an indication of the success of the measures implemented by the Chinese government. There was a jump in the number of deaths reported in mid-April in China, which results in a less robust estimate of the number of deaths predicted by the SIR model. The susceptible population dropped to zero very quickly in South Korea showing that the government was quick to act in con-",

In this context, it can be applied to communities, given reliable data are available. Its power also lies to the fact that, as new data are added to the model, it is easy to adjust its parameters and provide with best-fit curves between the data and the predictions from the model. It is in this context then, it can provide with estimates of the number of likely deaths in the future and time scales for decline in the number of infections in communities. Our results show that the SIR model is more suitable to predict the epidemic trend due to the spread of the disease as it can accommodate surges and be adjusted to the recorded data. By comparing the published data with predictions, it is possible to predict the success of government interventions. The considered data are taken in between January and June, 2020 that contains the datasets before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. Our analysis also confirms the success and failures in some countries in the control measures taken. Strict,  adequate  measures  have  to  be  implemented  to  further prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. Countries around the world have taken steps to decrease the number of infected citizens, such  as  lock-down  measures,  awareness  programs  promoted  via media, hand sanitization campaigns, etc. to slow down the trans- mission of the disease. Additional measures, including early detec- tion  approaches  and  isolation  of  susceptible  individuals  to  avoid mixing  them  with  no-symptoms  and  self-quarantine  individuals, traffic  restrictions,  and  medical  treatment  have  shown  they  can help to prevent the increase in the number of infected individuals. Strong lockdown policies can be implemented, in different areas, if possible. In line with this, necessary public health policies have to be implemented in countries with high rates of COVID-19 cases as early as possible to control its spread. The SIR model used here is only a simple one and thus, the predictions that come out might not be accurate enough, something that also depends on the pub- lished data and their trustworthiness. However, as the model data show, one thing that is certain is that COVID-19 is not going to go way quickly or easily.",
