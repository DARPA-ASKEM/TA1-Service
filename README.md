# Exctraction service

TA1 repository to interface with Terarium tools to interface with TA1 services.

## Goals

The extraction service will be hosted inside xDD to support extractions over non-open access documents: in this way, Terarium users will be able to work with models from non-public papers.

The extraction service will have several key endpoints:
- summarization/literature review
- extraction of a model
- profiling of a dataset
- model to dataset alignment suggestion
