Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.

The purpose of this study was to identify and validate conceptual domains around food safety culture and develop an assessment tool that can be used to assess food workers\u2019 perceptions of their restaurant\u2019s food safety culture. The study, conducted from March 2018 through March 2019, surveyed restaurant food workers for their level of agreement with 28 statements. We received 579 responses from 331 restaurants spread across eight different health department jurisdictions. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling supported a model composed of four primary constructs. The highest rated construct was Resource Availability (\n=4.69, sd=0.57), which assessed the availability of resources to maintain good hand hygiene. The second highest rated construct was Employee Commitment (=4.49, sd=0.62), which assessed workers\u2019 perceptions of their coworkers\u2019 commitment to food safety. The last two constructs were related to management. Leadership (=4.28, sd=0.69) assessed the existence of food safety policies, training, and information sharing. Management Commitment (=3.94, sd=1.05) assessed whether food safety was a priority in practice. Finally, the model revealed one higher-order construct, Worker Beliefs about Food Safety Culture (=4.35, sd=0.53). The findings from this study can support efforts by the restaurant industry, food safety researchers, and health departments to examine the influence and effects of food safety culture within

Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data.

Please refer to the metadata attachment for more information.\n\nLearn more about outdoor air quality on the Tracking Network's website: https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showAirLanding.action.\n\nBy using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the following requirements:\n1. Use the data for statistical reporting and analysis only.\n2. Do not attempt to learn the identity of any person included in the data and do not combine these data with other data for the purpose of matching records to identify individuals.\n3. Do not disclose of or make use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and report the discovery to: trackingsupport@cdc.gov.\n4. Do not imply or state, either in written or oral form, that interpretations based on the data are those of the original data sources and CDC unless the data user and data source are formally collaborating.\n5.
