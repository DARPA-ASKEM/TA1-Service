Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.
